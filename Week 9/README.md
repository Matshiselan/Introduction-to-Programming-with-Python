## Key Features

### Core Mathematical Functions
1. *Basic Arithmetic*: Standard operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
2. *Powers & Roots*: Square, cube, and \(x^{th}\) power of \(y\); square root, cube root, and \(x^{th}\) root.
3. *Logarithms*: Common logarithms (\(\log \)), natural logarithms (\(\ln \)), and \(10^{x}\) or \(e^{x}\) exponential functions.

### Advanced Mathematical Functions
1. *Trigonometry*: Sine, cosine, tangent, their inverses, and hyperbolic functions.
2. *Probability*: Permutations (\(nPr\)), combinations (\(nCr\)), factorials (\(n!\)), and random number generation (including dice, coin, and integer simulations).
3. *Statistics*: Single and two-variable statistics, including mean, standard deviation, and regression models (linear, quadratic, exponential, logarithmic).
4. *N-Base Number Systems*: Support for Binary, Pentals, Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal operations.
